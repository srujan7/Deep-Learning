# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project involves solutions to the handwritten digits recognition problem using both TensorFlow and PyTorch. The TensorFlow solution is courtesy of Peter Belhumeur, Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University.

The notebooks compare a simple softmax regressor, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) for their performance on this dataset. The CNN achieves an accuracy of ~99% on this problem. The PyTorch solution is configured to take advantage of a GPU for training if it is present.
